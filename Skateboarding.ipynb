              " 'output': \"Street skateboarding is a popular and dynamic sport that involves performing tricks and maneuvers on urban obstacles such as stairs, rails, ledges, and ramps. Here are some key rules and guidelines for street skateboarding:\\n\\n1. **Respect for Public Property**: Skaters should always respect public and private property. Skateboarding should only be done in designated skate parks or areas where skateboarding is permitted.\\n\\n2. **Safety Gear**: It is highly recommended to wear safety gear such as a helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards to prevent injuries while skateboarding.\\n\\n3. **Right of Way**: Skaters should be aware of their surroundings and give the right of way to pedestrians and other skaters. It is important to avoid collisions and be mindful of others sharing the space.\\n\\n4. **Trick Execution**: Street skateboarding involves performing a variety of tricks such as ollies, kickflips, grinds, and slides on obstacles. Skaters should practice and perfect their tricks before attempting them on challenging obstacles.\\n\\n5. **Judging Criteria**: In competitions, skaters are judged based on the difficulty, style, execution, and creativity of their tricks. Judges look for clean landings, control, and originality in the skater's performance.\\n\\n6. **Time Limit**: In some competitions, skaters may have a set time limit to showcase their skills and perform their best tricks. It is important for skaters to make the most of their allotted time.\\n\\n7. **Fair Play**: Skaters should exhibit good sportsmanship and fair play during competitions and casual skate sessions. Cheating, unsportsmanlike conduct, and disruptive behavior are not tolerated in the skateboarding community.\\n\\n8. **Learning Curve**: Street skateboarding requires dedication, practice, and perseverance to master new tricks and improve skills. Skaters should be patient with themselves and continue to push their limits to progress in the sport.\\n\\n9. **Community Engagement**: Skaters are encouraged to engage with the skateboarding community, support local skate shops and events, and promote a positive image of skateboarding as a creative and inclusive sport.\\n\\nBy following these rules and guidelines, street skateboarders can enjoy the sport safely, improve their skills, and contribute to the vibrant skateboarding culture.\"}"
